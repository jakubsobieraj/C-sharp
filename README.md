# C#

This repository holds all my coding in C# as part of the Pitman Training Bootcamp.

# Projects:

## Car Insurance MVC App

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

## Blackjack Console Game

This project is a fully interactive Blackjack (21) game built in C#. It runs in the console and simulates a casino-style experience where the player can place bets, play rounds against a dealer, and manage their balance over multiple hands. Features include:

Player setup – prompts the user for their name and starting bankroll.

Betting system – players place bets each round; winnings and losses update their balance.

Blackjack rules engine – calculates hand values with Ace flexibility, checks for blackjack, busts, and ties, and applies dealer rules (hit until 17).

Game flow – handles initial deal, player decisions (hit/stay), dealer turn, outcome comparison, and payouts.

Replay option – players can choose to continue playing until they quit or run out of money.

Object-oriented design – structured with classes like Player, Dealer, Deck, Card, Game, and BlackjackRules for modularity and readability.
